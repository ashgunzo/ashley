  <p>I miss the old Kanye, straight from the 'Go Kanye</br>
      Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye</br>
      I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye</br>
      The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye</br>
      I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye</br>
      I gotta to say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye</br>
      See I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes</br>
      And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes</br>
      I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye</br>
      I even had the pink Polo, I thought I was Kanye</br>
      What if Kanye made a song, about Kanye?</br>
      Called "I Miss The Old Kanye," man that would be so Kanye</br>
      That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye</br>
      And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye</p>
